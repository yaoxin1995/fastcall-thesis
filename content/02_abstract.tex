With the popularity of intelligent hardware like 
Smart NIC and NVMe based SSD\cite{10.1145/2757667.2757684}, the hardware's data transmission 
speed is getting faster and faster. This has led to the current kernel
I/O models are not suitable for data 
transmission anymore. When the application communicates
 with the device through system calls, the overhead of the kernel IO path 
 becomes not negligible in the context of NVMe-based SSD and smart NIC\cite{12}. 
 Thus, various technologies were invented, i.g. DPDK\cite{7} and XDP\cite{10.1145/3281411.3281443}.

 One of the novel technologies is bypassing the kernel, i.e., directly mapping the device into userspace. However, 
this has led to potential security issues because "there is 
no centralized and trusted entity to control the operations 
issued by applications to hardware, and most devices
themselves lack sufficient isolation mechanism." Therefore, this thesis proposes a new 
IO mechanism that reduces the kernel overhead by mapping the device into user space 
and provides isolation between applications and devices. 
 The evaluation shows this approach could significantly increase the performance 
 compared to the traditional IO path crossing the user kernel boundary. However, 
 we must avoid losing safety protection for devices or mitigate secure vulnerability 
 caused by bypassing the kernel entirely. We will try to
sketch Potential solutions to these problems, inspired by multiple 
classic attack models such as \emph{Meltdown}\cite{1}. In summary, with this new idea, 
performance-critical applications may have the ability to interact with 
PCIe devices in a low latency, software-based, less secured way.
