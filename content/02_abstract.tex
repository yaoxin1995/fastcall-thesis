With the popularity of intelligent hardware like 
Smart NIC and NVMe based SSD, the hardware's transmission 
speed is getting faster and faster. This has led to current 
I/O models supported by the kernel are not suitable for data 
transmission anymore. When the application tries to communicate
 with the device through system calls, the overhead of the kernel IO path 
 becomes not negligible in the context of NVMe-based SSD and smart NIC. 
 Thus, various technologies were invented, i.g. DPDK, SPDK, and XDP.

One of the novel technologies is bypassing the kernel 
by directly mapping the device into user space. However, 
this has led to potential security issues because "there is 
no centralized and trusted entity to control the operations 
issued by applications to hardware, and most devices
themselves lack sufficient isolation mechanism." Therefore, 
this thesis introduces a new system call mechanism to reduce 
the overhead caused by the kernel by mapping the device to the
 user space and provide isolation between user-land application and device. 
 The evaluation shows this approach could significantly increase the performance 
 compared to the traditional IO path crossing the user kernel boundary. However, 
 we must avoid losing safety protection for devices or mitigate secure vulnerability 
 caused by bypassing the kernel entirely. We will try to
sketch Potential solutions to these problems, inspired by multiple 
classic attack models such as meltdown. In summary, with this new idea, 
performance-critical applications may have the ability to interact with 
PCIe devices in low latency, software-based, less secured way.
